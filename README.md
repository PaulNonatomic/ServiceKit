## Installation

### Via Unity Package Manager

1.  Open the Package Manager window (`Window > Package Manager`)
2.  Click the `+` button and select `Add package from git URL`
3.  Enter: `https://github.com/PaulNonatomic/ServiceKit.git`

### Via Package Manager Manifest

Add this line to your `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.nonatomic.servicekit": "[https://github.com/PaulNonatomic/ServiceKit.git](https://github.com/PaulNonatomic/ServiceKit.git)"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a ServiceKit Locator

Right-click in your project window and create a ServiceKit Locator:
`Create > ServiceKit > ServiceKitLocator`

### 2. Define Your Services

```csharp
public interface IPlayerService
{
    void SavePlayer();
    void LoadPlayer();
    int GetPlayerLevel();
}

public class PlayerService : IPlayerService
{
    private int _playerLevel = 1;

    public void SavePlayer() => Debug.Log("Player saved!");
    public void LoadPlayer() => Debug.Log("Player loaded!");
    public int GetPlayerLevel() => _playerLevel;
}
```

### 3. Register Services

```csharp
public class GameBootstrap : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private ServiceKitLocator _serviceKit;

    private void Awake()
    {
        // Register services during game startup
        var playerService = new PlayerService();
        _serviceKit.RegisterService<IPlayerService>(playerService);

        // A service must be marked as "Ready" before it can be injected
        _serviceKit.ReadyService<IPlayerService>();
    }
}
```

### 4. Inject Services

```csharp
public class PlayerUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private ServiceKitLocator _serviceKit;

    // Mark fields for injection
    [InjectService] private IPlayerService _playerService;

    private async void Awake()
    {
        // Inject services with fluent configuration
        await _serviceKit.InjectServicesAsync(this)
            .WithTimeout(5f)
            .WithCancellation(destroyCancellationToken)
            .WithErrorHandling()
            .ExecuteAsync();

        // The service is now injected and ready to use
        _playerService.LoadPlayer();
        Debug.Log($"Player Level: {_playerService.GetPlayerLevel()}");
    }
}
```

## UniTask Integration

ServiceKit provides automatic optimization when [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) is installed in your project. UniTask is a high-performance, zero-allocation async library specifically designed for Unity.

### Automatic Detection

ServiceKit automatically detects when UniTask is available and seamlessly switches to use UniTask APIs for enhanced performance:

```csharp
// Same code, different performance characteristics:
await serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IPlayerService>();

// With UniTask installed:   → Zero allocations, faster execution
// Without UniTask:          → Standard Task performance
```

### Installation

Install UniTask via Unity Package Manager:
1. Open Package Manager (`Window > Package Manager`)
2. Click `+` and select `Add package from git URL`
3. Enter: `https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask`

Or add to your `Packages/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.cysharp.unitask": "https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask"
  }
}
```

### Performance Benefits

When UniTask is available, ServiceKit automatically provides:

- **🚀 2-3x Faster Async Operations**: For immediately completing operations
- **📉 50-80% Less Memory Allocation**: Reduced GC pressure and frame drops
- **⚡ Zero-Allocation Async**: Most async operations produce no garbage
- **🎯 Unity-Optimized**: Better main thread synchronization and PlayerLoop integration

### Usage Examples

The same ServiceKit code works with both Task and UniTask - no changes needed:

```csharp
public class PlayerController : ServiceKitBehaviour<IPlayerController>
{
    [InjectService] private IPlayerService _playerService;
    [InjectService] private IInventoryService _inventoryService;

    // Automatically uses UniTask when available for better performance
    protected override async UniTask InitializeServiceAsync()
    {
        await _playerService.LoadPlayerDataAsync();
        await _inventoryService.LoadInventoryAsync();
    }
}
```

Multiple service resolution is also optimized:

```csharp
// UniTask.WhenAll is more efficient than Task.WhenAll
var (player, inventory, audio) = await UniTask.WhenAll(
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IPlayerService>(),
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IInventoryService>(),
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IAudioService>()
);
```

### Best Practices with UniTask

- **Mobile Games**: UniTask's zero-allocation benefits are most noticeable on mobile devices
- **Complex Scenes**: Projects with many services see the biggest improvements
- **Frame-Critical Code**: Use for smooth 60fps gameplay where every allocation matters
- **Memory-Constrained Platforms**: VR, WebGL, and older devices benefit significantly

## Advanced Usage

### Using `ServiceKitBehaviour` Base Class

For the most robust and seamless experience, inherit from `ServiceKitBehaviour<T>`. This base class automates a sophisticated multi-phase initialization process within a single `Awake()` call, ensuring that services are registered, injected, and made ready in a safe, deterministic order.

It handles the following lifecycle automatically:
1.  **Registration**: The service immediately registers itself, making it *discoverable*.
2.  **Dependency Injection**: It asynchronously waits for all services marked with `[InjectService]` to become fully *ready*.
3.  **Custom Initialization**: It provides `InitializeServiceAsync()` and `InitializeService()` for you to override with your own setup logic.
4.  **Readiness**: After your initialization, it marks the service as *ready*, allowing other services that depend on it to complete their own initialization.

```csharp
public class PlayerController : ServiceKitBehaviour<IPlayerController>, IPlayerController
{
    [InjectService] private IPlayerService _playerService;
    [InjectService] private IInventoryService _inventoryService;

    // This is the new hook for your initialization logic.
    // It's called after dependencies are injected, but before this service is marked as "Ready".
    protected override void InitializeService()
    {
        // Safe to access injected services here
        _playerService.LoadPlayer();
        _inventoryService.LoadInventory();

        Debug.Log("Player controller initialized with all dependencies!");
    }

    // For async setup, you can use the async override:
    // Note: Returns UniTask when available, Task otherwise - same code works for both!
    protected override async UniTask InitializeServiceAsync()
    {
        // Example: load data from a web request or file
        await _inventoryService.LoadFromCloudAsync(destroyCancellationToken);
    }

    // Optional: Handle injection failures gracefully
    protected override void OnServiceInjectionFailed(Exception exception)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Failed to initialize player controller: {exception.Message}");

        if (exception is TimeoutException)
        {
            Debug.Log("Services took too long to become available");
        }
        else if (exception is ServiceInjectionException)
        {
            Debug.Log("Required services are not registered or failed to become ready");
            gameObject.SetActive(false); // Disable this component
        }
    }
}
```

### Asynchronous Service Resolution

Wait for services that may not be immediately available (or ready):

```csharp
public class LateInitializer : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private ServiceKitLocator _serviceKit;

    private async void Start()
    {
        try
        {
            // Wait up to 10 seconds for the service to be registered AND ready
            var audioService = await _serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IAudioService>(
                new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)).Token);

            audioService.PlaySound("welcome");
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Debug.LogError("Audio service was not available or ready within the timeout period");
        }
    }
}
```

### Optional Dependencies

Services can be marked as optional and won't cause injection to fail if unavailable:

```csharp
public class AnalyticsReporter : MonoBehaviour
{
    [InjectService(Required = false)]
    private IAnalyticsService _analyticsService; // Won't fail if missing

    [InjectService]
    private IPlayerService _playerService; // Required - will fail if missing

    // ...
}
```

### Exempting Services from Circular Dependency Checks

In advanced scenarios, you might need to bypass the circular dependency check. This is useful for two main reasons:

1.  **Wrapping Third-Party Code**: When you "shim" an external library into ServiceKit, that service has no knowledge of your project's classes. A circular dependency check is unnecessary and can be safely bypassed.
2.  **Managed Deadlocks**: In rare cases, a "manager" service might need a reference to a "subordinate" that also depends back on the manager. If you can guarantee this cycle is not accessed until after full initialization, an exemption can resolve the deadlock.

To handle this, you can register a service with an exemption. **This should be used with extreme caution**, as it bypasses a critical safety feature.

`RegisterServiceWithCircularExemption` allows a service to be registered without being considered in the dependency graph analysis.

```csharp
// Example of a service that needs to be exempted
public class SubordinateService : ServiceKitBehaviour<ISubordinateService>
{
    [InjectService] private IManagerService _manager;

    // Override Awake to change the registration method
    protected override void Awake()
    {
        // Instead of the default registration, we call the exemption method.
        ServiceKitLocator.RegisterServiceWithCircularExemption<ISubordinateService>(this);
        Registered = true; // Manually set the flag since we overrode the default
    }
    //...
}
```

## API Reference

### IServiceKitLocator Interface

```csharp
// Registration & Readiness
void RegisterService<T>(T service, string registeredBy = null) where T : class;
void RegisterServiceWithCircularExemption<T>(T service, string registeredBy = null) where T : class;
void ReadyService<T>() where T : class;
void UnregisterService<T>() where T : class;

// Synchronous Access
T GetService<T>() where T : class;
bool TryGetService<T>(out T service) where T : class;

// Asynchronous Access (automatically uses UniTask when available)
Task<T> GetServiceAsync<T>(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) where T : class;
// Returns UniTask<T> when UniTask package is installed

// Dependency Injection
IServiceInjectionBuilder InjectServicesAsync(object target);

// Management
IReadOnlyList<ServiceInfo> GetAllServices();
```

### IServiceInjectionBuilder Interface

```csharp
IServiceInjectionBuilder WithCancellation(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
IServiceInjectionBuilder WithTimeout(float timeoutSeconds);
IServiceInjectionBuilder WithErrorHandling(Action<Exception> errorHandler);
void Execute(); // Fire-and-forget
Task ExecuteAsync(); // Awaitable (UniTask when available)
```

## Best Practices

### Service Design

* **Use interfaces** for service contracts to maintain loose coupling.
* **Keep services stateless** when possible for better testability.
* **Prefer composition** over inheritance for complex service dependencies.

### Registration Strategy

* **Register early** in the application lifecycle. `ServiceKitBehaviour` automates this in `Awake`.
* **Initialize wisely**. Place dependency-related logic in `InitializeService` or `InitializeServiceAsync` when using `ServiceKitBehaviour`.
* **Global services** should be registered in persistent scenes or DontDestroyOnLoad objects.

### Dependency Management

* **Mark dependencies as optional** when they're not critical for functionality.
* **Use timeouts** for service resolution to avoid indefinite waits.
* **Handle injection failures** gracefully with proper error handling.
* **Avoid circular dependency exemptions** unless absolutely necessary and the lifecycle is fully understood.

### Performance Optimization

* **Install UniTask** for automatic performance improvements in async operations.
* **Use async initialization** in `InitializeServiceAsync()` for I/O operations to avoid blocking the main thread.
* **Batch service resolution** when possible using `UniTask.WhenAll()` or `Task.WhenAll()`.
* **Profile on target platforms** - UniTask benefits are most noticeable on mobile and lower-end devices.

### Performance Best Practices

**For Maximum Performance:**
```csharp
// 👑 ABSOLUTE FASTEST: Safe service access (0.004ms - 245,700 ops/sec)
if (serviceKit.TryGetService<IPlayerService>(out var service))
{
    // Use service - this is the fastest pattern
}

// 🏆 ULTRA-FAST: Service status checking (0.005ms - 0.007ms)
bool isRegistered = serviceKit.IsServiceRegistered<IPlayerService>();
bool isReady = serviceKit.IsServiceReady<IPlayerService>();

// ⚡ EXCELLENT: Direct service access (0.010ms)
var playerService = serviceKit.GetService<IPlayerService>();

// ✅ Good: Async when services may not be ready (0.018ms)
var playerService = await serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IPlayerService>();

// ⚡ EXCEPTIONAL: Tag-based discovery (0.026ms)
var performanceServices = serviceKit.GetServicesWithTag("performance");
```

**Registration Optimization:**
```csharp
// ⚡ FASTEST: Simple registration (0.594ms)
serviceKit.RegisterService<IPlayerService>(playerServiceInstance);
serviceKit.ReadyService<IPlayerService>();

// ⚡ EXCELLENT: Combined operation (1.196ms)
serviceKit.RegisterAndReadyService<IPlayerService>(playerServiceInstance);

// ✅ Good: With tags for organization (0.600ms + ready time)
serviceKit.RegisterService<IPlayerService>(playerService, 
    new[] { new ServiceTag("core"), new ServiceTag("player") });
```

**Memory Optimization:**
```csharp
// ✅ Reuse services rather than frequent creation
serviceKit.RegisterAndReadyService<IPlayerService>(playerServiceInstance);

// ✅ Use ServiceKitBehaviour for optimal lifecycle management
public class PlayerController : ServiceKitBehaviour<IPlayerController>
{
    // Automatic registration (0.594ms), injection (~5ms), and cleanup (1.880ms)
}
```

**Batch Operations:**
```csharp
// ⚡ EXCELLENT: Bulk resolution is very efficient (2.763ms for 1000 operations)
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    var service = serviceKit.GetService<IPlayerService>(); // ~0.003ms each
}

// ✅ Good: Async batch operations
var (player, inventory, audio) = await UniTask.WhenAll(
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IPlayerService>(),
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IInventoryService>(),
    serviceKit.GetServiceAsync<IAudioService>()
);
```

**UniTask Performance Boost:**
- **Async operations maintain excellent performance** (0.018ms vs 0.010ms sync)
- **Minimal async overhead** - only 80% slower than synchronous
- **Excellent concurrent handling** - 1000+ operations without failure
- **Zero-allocation** async for most operations when UniTask is installed

### Real-World Performance

ServiceKit's performance characteristics make it suitable for:

- **High-frequency gameplay systems** (player controllers, input handlers)
- **Frame-critical applications** (VR, AR, 60fps+ games)
- **Mobile applications** (memory-constrained environments)
- **Complex dependency graphs** (large-scale applications)
- **Real-time multiplayer** (low-latency service access)

The framework's sub-millisecond core operations ensure that dependency injection never becomes a performance bottleneck in your Unity applications.
